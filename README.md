# SofaV-V

This project aims at providing a template, a structure and data for the verification and validation of Sofa components. The end-goal is to have an idea of the performances of each compoenent following different criteria, which can be computation accuracy and speed for example.

The structure of the project is inspired from the "examples" repository of the Sofa source code, which attributes to each component a scene example for testing. Ideally, each component could have its corresponding verification/validation file.
